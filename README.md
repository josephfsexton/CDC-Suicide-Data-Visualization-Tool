# U.S.-Suicide-Compiler

Integrating mortality data from the CDC and population data from the U.S. Census, the USSDC can answer any number of targeted questions on the epidemiology of American suicide between 2009 and 2019. If you are interested in the role of age on suicide rate, you can visualize this effect not just for the general population -- but also for unmarried, Black, Hispanic men in particular. In fact, you can sort by population for _any combination_ of sex, age, marital status, race, ethnicity, and education. You can also sort by specific kinds of suicides. Knowing means restriction is a leading form of suicide prevention, our tool is the first to visualize (as an example) how gun suicides vary for any racial or gender demographic over time. Sociologists may take great interest in the place of death for the suicide: was it at home, or was it outside, and how does this vary by race? **Exploratory data analysis is practically limitless.**
